## ⚠️ Safety Limits

### **LinkedIn**
- **Daily Limit**: 10 messages (built-in)
- **Delay**: 30-60 seconds between messages
- **Detection**: Anti-bot delays and human-like behavior

### **Email**
- **No Limit**: Use Mailchimp/SendGrid for bulk sending
- **Best Practice**: Don't send 300 at once, spread over 3 days

### **WhatsApp**
- **No Limit**: Manual send via pre-filled links
- **Best Practice**: 50-100 per day to avoid spam

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Please set Product Description first"
- Open extension → Settings → Enter product description → Save

### "Daily limit reached"
- You already sent 10 LinkedIn messages today
- Wait until tomorrow (resets at midnight)

### "No leads with email"
- Scrape more profiles (not all have emails in About section)
- Look for profiles with "Email:" or "@" in About

### Backend not running
- Terminal: `cd backend` → `python main.py`
- Should see "API running at: http://localhost:8000"
